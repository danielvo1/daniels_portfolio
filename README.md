# My Portfolio
I was tasked to make a responsive portfolio webpage that will contain links to my work as well as my contact information. 
## Getting Started

For this project I was given no start code. In order to start the project I created a repository in github that had a README starter file. After cloning it down into my local machine I began to code my webpage. 


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

Say what the step will be:

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
